<h1>
Proposal: CIS Student Remote Virtual Machine Server<br>
Matthew Bader and Sean Garey
</h1>

<p>
<b>Intro:<br></b>
Computer Information Science students at Vermont Technical College have a need for virtual machines throughout their education. <br>
However, not every student has the system resources to host a virtual machine. Currently, at Vermont Tech, there is no virtual <br>
machine server where students can log in, and spin up a machine to use for their studies. This project seeks to fill this gap <br>
and provide a service to students. They will be able to access a webpage and log into a protected page. There, they will be able <br>
to select a virtual machine, an operating system, and create it. After this, they will be able to remote into their new machine. <br>
This will give them easy access to virtual machines, without utilizing their own system’s resources. Currently, there are several<br>
 free bare-metal hypervisors that include web interfaces. These web interfaces include APIs; our end goal will be to create our <br>
 own web application that utilizes these APIs, enabling specific user permissions.<br>
<br>
<b>Project Description:<br></b>
In this project, we will create a virtual machine server that allows users to create and configure virtual machines via a web interface. <br>
They can then remote into this virtual machine and use it for their CIS classes. The expected server will allow students to log in via a <br>
password-protected web interface where they can then select a configuration for the virtual machine that they need. Once the student has<br>
 selected the hardware and software configuration for their virtual machine, the server will start a virtual machine with the selected <br>
 setting. The student is then able to remote into the virtual machine that they created and use the machine as they would any other virtual <br>
 machine. <br>
To properly allow the student to use the virtual machine the application will need to properly configure the hardware and networking settings<br>
 that were selected and start the virtual machine. <br>

<b>Similar Products:<br></b>
There are multiple similar products that do many of the same things that we are looking to do with our project. Products like<br>
 Nitanix AHV Virtualization, VMware vSphere, Citrix DaaS, and Proxmox all have the ability to create and manage multiple virtual<br>
 machines. The main difference that many of these products have that will be solved with our project is the price of these <br>
 products. These products are enterprise solutions and can cost tens of thousands of dollars in some cases. The next thing that<br>
 is different about our project will be the ability for a user to create and use a virtual machine without accessing having the <br>
 ability to access the other virtual machines running. Many of these similar products do not have the ability for a user to <br>
 configure and use a virtual machine without also being able to access all of the other machines running.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Deliverables:<br></b>
The following are the deliverables for this project:<br>
Server running a bare metal hypervisor connected to its web interface<br>
Custom permission-based web interface to control the existing off-the-shelf web interface allowing users to create and configure 
virtual machines<br>
Documentation of complete project including testing<br>
Three required presentations and required course documentation<br>
